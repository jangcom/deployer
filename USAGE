OPTIONS

            The path to which designated files will be deployed.

        -all (short form: -a)
            All files in the current working directory will be deployed.

        old_file=new_file ...
            A pair of a filename and its to-be-deployed filename.
            old_file will be used as new_file if new_file is omitted.
            Multiple pairs should be delimited by the space character.
            Accordingly, no space characters are allowed around the equals sign (=).

            The front matter will not be displayed at the beginning of the program.

        -nopause
            The shell will not be paused at the end of the program.
